                <h1>Welcome to my first activity in ITDEV-160!</h1>
                <p lang="en-us">This is my first time working with HTML and CSS.
                    However, after spending time with it this could prove to be
                    a lifelong skill. I look forward to nurturing this skill! </p>
                </h2>Background</h2>
                <p>A fun fact about me is that I attended MC<sup>2</sup>
                for High School and learned some coding using Scratch!</p>
                <h2>MSOE</h2>
                <p>During my time a MSOE i learned how to raise numbers to higher
                    powers using the exponential system such as 10 being raised to 
                    the <sup>2</sup> power. I also learned how to conduct labs in 
                    Chemistry. We combined H and O<sub>2</sub> to make H<sub>2</sub>O.
                    There were many safety feature that were required before labs. some
                    of these safety requirements included: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gloves</li>
                        <li>Goggles</li>
                        <li>Mask</li>
                        <li>Cloak</li>
                        <li>Extinguisher</li>
                    </ul>
                    From this list you can tell that Chemistry was a very hands on and
                    exciting class to be in!
