        <h1 id="top">Apple Vs. Android</h1>
        <p id="introduction">In last years battle of the flagship electronics Apple
            & Samsung were neck and neck as far as competitiveness is concerned. The iPhone
            11 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S 10+ were very formidable in sales and what they each offered
            consumers. I for one am a hardcore Apple fanboy. I've bought my own iPhones since I was
            15 and have been purchasing then latest ever since. I must admit I am quite biased when it 
            comes to functionality and OS, however I must also admit that Samsung is bringing the heat and 
            stepping up with additional features and must have quality of life updates. Competition is always great
            and I wish the best to both companies for the sake of the consumers!
        </p>
        <h2 id="middle"> iPhone</h2>
        <p>The design of the iPhone has an iconic design that is beloved worldwide. This is most likely one
            of the reasons why the design has a very hard time changing only ever so slightly over the last 5 years.
            Design aside, the functionality of the device is what will take the cake for most users. The simplicity
            of syncing your phone with your contacts and emails really gives the consumer a peace of mind when utilizing
            this device. The sleekness and longevity of this device to last year after year is also another fine selling
            point with guaranteed updates for 5 years after your purchase. When going out on a limb for a $$$ costly device
            you want to feel assured you are making the right choice without putting a pit in your gut. The iPhone will 
            always be a safe bet for me. Anyone else agree with this perspective?

        <h3>Galaxy</h3>
        <p class="Phones" id="bottom"> The Samsung Galaxy phones have been a very prominent and pivitol competitor to the
            iPhone. I will always say competition is great for business as it forces other companies to step their game up.
            Some would disagree with that statement, but without that competitive spirit there is no will for advancemment.
            Businesses without a will to advance will ultimately become complacement and be overtaken by another hard working
            company with what they are lacking! So far for iPhone and Galaxy phones that will is there and it will thrust our
            nation forward!

            <figcaption>The Galaxy S 10+ is one of the latest mainstream, Flagship, and Powerful devices.
                Although I am not in love with the Galaxy series I must give honor where honor is due. Samsung
                packs some heat with this device and its been neck in neck as far as sales and utilization goes.
                As always, I personally believe competition is great and it forces the rival to step up or get out!
