            <h1>Reading to Enrich Your Soul</h1>
            <p>Hello and welcome to the beginning of a brighter future. My name
               is Imani and I want to shed some light on a very valuable life choice.
               Reading is an invaluable resource that is used to expand the horizon of
               all who take heed and grasp onto this fountain of youth.

                    <li>Create A Reading Hour Or A Reading Day</li>
                </ul> 
                These options are guaranteed to curate an exceptional reader. One great benefit I personally experience has
                to do with an enhanced perception on many topics that actually coordinate with what i'm currently reading.
                Reading gives the brain pause and allows it to flex it's critical thinking skills and allow the pressures of life
                to decompress as you're swept away into a serene ocean of knowledge and power.
            </p>
            <h3>Knowledge Is Power! Use It Wisely!</h3>
            <img src="images/feedyourbrain2.jpeg" alt="Photograph of a cat in the hat look alike reading a book." />
            <p>You may think this quote is just a cheesy cliche, but if that were the case why then are the world's elites constantly
                found engaged in reading day in and day out? Important people all around the world are feeding their brains with knowledge
                which in turn allows them to operate from a more informed position resulting in better outcomes. Billionaires don't become
                billionaires let alone stay billionaires without reading about and being taught about financial literacy and real-world examples
                on how to conduct their business. Today we live in a technology age and knowledge is at our fingertips. Anything you could dream of
                can be searched and researched for the betterment of any and all lives.
            </p>
            <h4>More Is Required Of You</h4>
            <img src="images/feedyourbrain3.jpeg" alt="Photograph of a brain with glasses reading a book." />
            <p>In Todays society more is required of you than ever before. Reading cannot be replaced with watching TV or browsing the internet for cute cat pics.
                This technology age provides much, but it requires much sort of like a give and take relationship. If you as an individual don't keep up with the
                advancing technologies of today you will be left behind speedily and without remorse. This is what makes today a scary place to live. However, as
                you take one day at a time and practice reading while building up some of those healthy habits we talked about earlier you will change your life
                for the better indefinitely. If you become one of the world's next billionaires be sure to give me a shout out because that will go a long way in
                today's standards. If for any reason the standards change so drastically that it no longer goes a long way then 100 million dollars due to inflation
                will suffice. I hope you enjoyed this message and lastly I will create a list of books to start you off that you really should make time to ready today!
